Crypt_Xtea documentation
------------------------
$Id$

The Crypt_Xtea package is a simple class to enable XTEA encryption on
sites where e.g. the mcrypt module is not installed.
The original C code on which this class is based was found at
from http://vader.brad.ac.uk/tea/source.shtml#new_ansi

Use of the class is fairly straightforward:

<?php
	require_once 'Crypt/Xtea.php';

	$data = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
	$key = '0123456789abcdef';

	$crypt = new Crypt_Xtea();
	$encrypted = $crypt->encrypt($data, $key);
	$decrypted = $crypt->encrypt($encrypt, $key);
?>

The output of both the encrypt() and decrypt() functions is a binary
string.

For your convenience a PHPUnit test class and test script have been
installed in the PEAR tests directory. To use it, check the Makefile
or try:

	make profile test

In version 1.1 a major bug in doing signed/unsigned calculations was
fixed after reports on the class not working on a Mac (thanks to
David Costa). Due to the fix the encryption/decryption process is now
relatively slow. Please check whether the amounts of data you want to
encrypt are relatively small, otherwise I'd suggest using the mcrypt
module.
